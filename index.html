                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Bettendorf Financial Group was founded in 1996 by Douglas Wier, and with over 30-years of financial services experience, he continues to run the firm today. Doug has used his experience and expertise to attract and train many advisors over the years, which has resulted in the strong team of knowledgeable and committed advisors and support staff the firm has today. The team at Bettendorf Financial Group offers assistance with insurance and investment recommendations, as well as creating financial, estate, education, social security, and retirement planning strategies, in a family-style atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Like many other financial service firms, we offer financial planning, investment advice, retirement planning, life and disability insurance, annuities, and social security strategy advice. Unlike many others, we do not offer one-size fits all type of advice. We work with you, our client on an individualized, case-by-case, basis. We want to get to know you, your interests, your financial goals, both long-term and short, your worries, as well as your unique family circumstances. We feel it is very important to know you, in order to make the most suitable recommendations to help meet your needs as well as make you feel comfortable with the decisions we make together.</p>
                    <p>For more information about us, please visit <a href="#">Our Team.</a></p>

                    <h1 class="services">What We Do</h1>
                    <p>Based upon your needs, financial situation, and what you feel comfortable with, we can work with you on either a transactional basis, meaning we are paid commissions based on the investments that you make with us, or we can work with you on an advisory basis, meaning we are paid based on a percent of assets. Also, when we are working with you on an advisory basis, we are serving as fiduciaries, which means we are legally and ethically required to work in your best interests. Either way, it is our firm’s policy to always put our client’s best interest before our own, as evidenced by our exemplary compliance record.</p>
                    <p>Also, we have relationships with many area professionals when additional needs are discovered, such as trust planning, tax preparation, or other advanced planning needs. We recognize our limitations, and prefer to offer referrals to other qualified financial professionals when the need arises. And rest assured, our only compensation for any referrals is your satisfaction.</p>
